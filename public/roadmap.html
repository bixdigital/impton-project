        <h2>Roadmap for IMPACT TON</h2>
        <p>IMPACT TON (IMPTON) is not just a token; it's a vision for creating a vibrant community where users are empowered, and engagement is encouraged. Our roadmap outlines the critical phases that will lead us toward achieving this goal.</p>
        
        <h3>Phase 1: Token Creation</h3>
        <p>We have successfully launched the IMPCTON token on the TON blockchain. This phase involved defining the tokenomics, ensuring low transaction fees, and setting up the initial infrastructure.</p>
        
        <h3>Phase 2: Community Building</h3>
        <p>We believe that a strong community is the backbone of any successful project. During this phase, we will focus on building an active and engaged community through various initiatives, including social media campaigns, community events, and educational content to help users understand the benefits of using IMPCTON.</p>
        
        <h3>Phase 3: Token Distribution</h3>
        <p>After establishing our community, we will initiate the token distribution process. This will involve airdrops, rewards for community participation, and incentivizing early adopters to encourage more users to join the ecosystem.</p>
        
        <h3>Phase 4: dApp Launch</h3>
        <p>Once our community is thriving and the tokens are distributed, we will launch our decentralized application (dApp) that integrates with the IMPACT TON ecosystem. The dApp will provide various features, including staking, farming, and engaging games that utilize our token.</p>
        
        <h3>Phase 5: Expand Use Cases</h3>
        <p>As we grow, we aim to expand the use cases for IMPCTON, exploring partnerships with other projects, integrating with existing platforms, and enhancing the overall utility of the token.</p>
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>At IMPACT TON, we are committed to transparency, innovation, and community-driven growth. Join us on this exciting journey as we empower users and revolutionize the blockchain experience.</p>
